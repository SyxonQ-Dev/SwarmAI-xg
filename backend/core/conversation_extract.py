"""Conversation → DDD extractor (capability C, DoD2, run_e346b8ed).

The CONSERVATIVE judgment layer of capability C. Reads a bounded batch of
authorized group-channel messages and asks an LLM to extract ONLY settled,
owner-ratified conclusions worth sedimenting into a project's DDD — emitting a
FEW high-signal candidates or NONE.

Division of responsibility (the reframe that shaped this design):
  - "Is this a settled decision vs chatter?" is inherently LLM-semantic — it
    lives HERE, in a conservative prompt that defaults to emitting nothing.
  - "A wrong extraction can never auto-write DDD" is STRUCTURAL — it lives in
    ddd_cultivation._cultivate_proposals (the source_stage=="conversation"
    guard). This module never writes DDD; it only produces candidates that
    cultivate_from_conversation routes through the human-gate.

宁缺毋滥 (DEC19: False > Stale > Imperfect): the extractor's default is REJECT.
A missed team decision is safe; a wrong DDD entry poisons an authoritative
substrate. Every knob here (tier gate, owner-ratification, conservative prompt)
biases toward emitting less.

Two structural gates enforced in code (NOT left to the prompt):
  1. TIER RE-ASSERT ON READ — only OWNER/TRUSTED inbound messages are fed to the
     LLM, re-checking the stored sender_tier even though the A-write path already
     filtered. Defense-in-depth: never trust the store alone.
  2. OWNER-RATIFICATION PRECONDITION (§9-D3) — if the owner never spoke in the
     batch, there is nothing XG could have ratified in-thread, so we return []
     WITHOUT calling the LLM. Team agreement without the owner is deliberately
     not captured.

worse than a missing one. When in doubt, extract NOTHING.

A candidate qualifies ONLY if ALL are true:
  1. It is an EXPLICIT conclusion — a decision, requirement, or constraint —
     NOT an open question, a "maybe", a proposal still under discussion, or
     brainstorming.
  2. The OWNER (tier=owner) CONCURRED IN-THREAD. A conclusion the owner did not
     explicitly agree to does NOT qualify, even if others agreed.
  3. It names a CONCRETE, actionable change (a convention, a requirement, a
     decision) — not a vague direction.

For each qualifying candidate output an object with:
  - "content": the DDD entry, 1-3 sentences, self-contained.
  - "target_doc": one of PRODUCT.md | TECH.md | IMPROVEMENT.md | PROJECT.md
     (your best SUGGESTION — a human confirms/re-targets it later).
  - "target_section": a plausible section name in that doc.
  - "evidence": the VERBATIM conversation line(s) that prove owner ratification.
  - "confidence": 0.0-1.0.

Output ONLY a JSON object: {{"candidates": [ ... ]}}. If nothing qualifies,
output {{"candidates": []}} — that is the EXPECTED result for most conversations.

    attacker-chosen. The four keep-class types (principle/correction/decision/model)
    are not cosmetic: ``retire_entry`` refuses a keep-class target unless a curator
    passes ``force=True``. Measured — the same lesson tagged ``[correction]`` refuses
    to retire, while the identical body left untagged classifies as ``guideline`` and
    retires normally. So a self-assigned keep-class tag converts an ordinary entry into
    one that costs a deliberate override to remove.

    Only the TAG is dropped, never the body: the writer then classifies the text on its
    merits (the same call it makes for the ~all candidates that carry no tag), so a
    lesson that genuinely reads as a correction can still BE one — it just cannot
    DECLARE itself one from untrusted input. Non-keep tags pass through untouched,
    keeping the feature intact for every type that carries no removal protection.

    This belongs at the same boundary that validates ``target_doc``, and for the same
