"""Shared definitions for the bounded-spawn contract.

This module is the ONE place the "does this prompt state a scope cap?" question is
answered. ``test_deliver_template_drift.py`` imports ``CAPS_RE`` from here rather
than keeping its own copy: two regexes for one contract drift apart silently, and
the divergence is invisible until an emitter refuses a prompt the test blesses (or
the reverse).

WHY A NUMERIC CAP AND NOT A WALL CLOCK: an unbounded review prompt has no
termination condition, so the sub-agent searches until it gives up. The fix is to
bound the SEARCH SPACE (files, tool calls, answer length), never the clock — a
timeout would truncate a review that is still finding real defects, converting a
slow success into a silent partial failure.

WHY THE PATTERN MATCHES INTENT AND NOT ONE PHRASING: real prompts in the corpus
use many spellings of the same cap ("at most 4 files", "At most 14 tool calls",
"read at most 4 files", "≤1 file"). A literal check on one of them passes by luck
and goes quietly vacuous the moment an author rewords, so the regex accepts any
"<limit-word> <number> <files|tool>" form.

#: disable the check. Kept in sync with nothing — this IS the definition.

#: ``(?:\w+\s+){0,2}`` before the noun admits the wordings authors actually write
#: ("at most 4 source files", "at most 6 more tool calls"). A cap this pattern
#: wrongly REJECTS blocks a human at exit 2, and a tool that blocks legitimate

    neither is one where the only number lives in unrelated prose.

    WHY THE SEARCH IS WINDOWED and not whole-file: a cap phrase appearing in an
    example, a quotation, or a negation ("do not limit yourself to at most 4
    files") satisfies a whole-file scan, so the check would pass for a prompt
    with no budget at all. The sibling drift test learned this the hard way —
    scoping its search to the budget paragraph was what made it non-vacuous — and
    applying one definition at two different SCOPES is the same divergence this
