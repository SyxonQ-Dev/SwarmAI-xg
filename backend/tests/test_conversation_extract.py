"""DoD2 (run_e346b8ed): conservative conversation→DDD extractor.

Drives the REAL extract_candidates. The ONLY thing mocked is the LLM boundary
(invoke_fn) — everything else (tier re-assert, owner-ratification precondition,
candidate hygiene) is exercised for real.

Conservatism is proven by the structural gates that fire BEFORE the LLM:
  - unauthorized/unknown-tier messages are dropped (tier re-assert on READ)
  - owner-absent batch → [] WITHOUT calling the LLM (§9-D3)
  - evidence-less candidates from the LLM are dropped (traceability hygiene)
