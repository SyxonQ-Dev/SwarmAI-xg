        Why the prior rule was reversed — MEASURED production evidence, not a
        hypothetical: the SwarmAI archive held 109,593 bullets that deduped to 277
        unique (99.7% silt); the top offenders were the SAME lesson re-written
        845–1690× across different sections/dates/session-ids (e.g. 'prevention
        over recovery' written 845 times). The old section-scoped rule was the
        direct mechanism that let a lesson re-accumulate under a different heading.
        The legitimate 'same short phrase in What Worked vs What Failed' case is
        protected by content_signature being WHOLE-STRING: a real success/failure

class TestWriteTargetConfinement:
    """PATH CONFINEMENT on every ddd_path-derived write/read target.

    Five sinks resolved a caller-supplied ``target_doc`` through ``ddd_path`` and then
    wrote or read, with no containment: ``ddd_paths`` returns an UNKNOWN key unchanged,
    so traversal segments survive resolution. A ``target_doc`` of
    ``../.context/STEERING.md`` therefore appended attacker-chosen content to a
    governance file that is injected into every agent session.

    A READ sink is a sink too, which is why three of the five are reads: the titles they
    parse out of the resolved document flow back into the proposal, and the identity one
    of them returns is what the DESTRUCTIVE applier then matches on — so an out-of-tree
    read both leaks governance content and steers a deletion.

    These tests assert BYTES-UNCHANGED and NO-NEW-SIBLING-FILES on the victim, not
    merely a status string: the append applier commits via ``os.replace`` BEFORE
    returning, and for a TRAVERSAL the destructive applier's out-of-tree effects are
    sibling CREATIONS (an ``-archive.md`` next to the victim, plus a ``.md.lock``) that a
    byte-comparison on the victim alone cannot see.

    Neither assertion is sufficient alone, and the sibling one is NOT general: under the
    hardlink shape the archive and lock land in-tree beside the LINK, so the victim's
    directory is unchanged while its BYTES are destroyed. Each escape route needs the
    assertion that can actually observe ITS effect — which is why the hardlink test
    asserts bytes and the traversal tests assert both.

    Beyond path containment this class also covers STRUCTURE FORGERY, because a write
    that lands in a permitted file can still fabricate content the document's parsers
    read as structure. Those tests validate a caller-supplied field against EVERY lexer
    that parses the sink (heading, entry bullet, prose entry, lifecycle metadata, maturity
    annotation) — guarding one of five left four forgeries reachable.
