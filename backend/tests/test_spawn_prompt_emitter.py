"""Gate-prompt emitter contract — the spawn-time half of the bounded-spawn rule.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read before changing an assertion):

Sub-agent spawns whose prompt states no scope cap run far longer than bounded
ones — measured over 4242 real Agent spawns, an unbounded review-class spawn's
median wall-clock was ~5.7x a bounded one's. Two earlier fixes wrote a fenced
``SCOPE BUDGET`` into the stage docs and collapsed seven wordings into one
authority block, and ``test_deliver_template_drift.py`` guards that those
DOCUMENTS say the right thing. Both are green. Yet gate spawns kept shipping
unbounded, because the orchestrator HAND-COMPOSES each gate prompt and a
document it is supposed to copy from is not a mechanism.

So the prompt bodies now live in ``data/gate-prompts/<gate>.md`` — one whole file
per gate, with NO enclosing fence — and the orchestrator gets them by running
``scripts/spawn_prompt.py --gate <id>`` instead of retyping. Two properties are
what make this worth its code:

1. A cap-less prompt is UNEMITTABLE: the emitter exits 2 with EMPTY stdout, so a
   budget cannot be silently dropped by an author.
2. There is no fenced body left in the stage docs to copy, so the lazy path now
   goes THROUGH the emitter rather than around it.

WHY WHOLE-FILE AND NOT FENCE EXTRACTION (a defect this design avoids by
construction, found by adversarial review before it shipped): the Gate-1 body in
``stages/build.md`` itself contained a nested ``` block. Any find-the-next-fence
extractor closes on that nested fence and silently drops the tail — in the real
file that dropped the MANDATORY output-format spec, so ``GATE 1 VERDICT``
vanished from the emitted prompt while the numeric caps survived and the
fail-closed check still passed. A capped prompt with no verdict format is worse
than an unbounded one. A depth-counting parser does not save it either: per
CommonMark a ``` fence closes a ``` fence, so same-length nesting is genuinely
ambiguous. Whole-file prompts delete the problem instead of out-parsing it.

INTEGRITY OF THE MOVE is pinned by SHA-256 digests of the bodies as they existed
in their stage docs immediately BEFORE the move (``_PRE_MOVE_SHA256``). A digest
is used rather than ``git show HEAD:<stage doc>`` deliberately: after the move
commit lands, HEAD's stage doc no longer contains the body, so a HEAD-relative
comparison degrades to comparing nothing — a test that passes because it checks
nothing. The digest is immutable, so it keeps working forever.
